    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        28 oz (800g) boneless and skinless chicken thighs or breasts cut into
        bite-sized pieces
      </li>
      <li>1/2 cup plain yogurt</li>
      <li>1 1/2 tablespoons minced garlic</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon minced ginger (or finely grated)</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons garam masala</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon turmeric</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon red chili powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a bowl, combine chicken with all of the ingredients for the chicken
        marinade; let marinate for 30 minutes to an hour (or overnight if time
        allows).
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a large skillet or pot over medium-high heat. When sizzling,
        add chicken pieces in batches of two or three, making sure not to crowd
        the pan. Fry until browned for only 3 minutes on each side. Set aside
        and keep warm. (You will finish cooking the chicken in the sauce.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat butter or ghee in the same pan. Fry the onions until they start to
        sweat (about 6 minutes) while scraping up any browned bits stuck on the
        bottom of the pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add garlic and ginger and sauté for 1 minute until fragrant, then add
        ground coriander, cumin and garam masala. Let cook for about 20 seconds
        until fragrant, while stirring occasionally.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add crushed tomatoes, chili powder and salt. Let simmer for about 10-15
        minutes, stirring occasionally until sauce thickens and becomes a deep
        brown red colour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the puréed sauce back into the pan. Stir the cream, sugar and
        crushed kasoori methi (or fenugreek leaves) through the sauce. Add the
        chicken with juices back into the pan and cook for an additional 8-10
        minutes until chicken is cooked through and the sauce is thick and
        bubbling.
      </li>
      <li>
        Garnish with chopped cilantro and serve with fresh, hot garlic butter
        rice and fresh homemade Naan bread!
      </li>
    </ol>
